  <p class="intro"> 
    Although we only think about recycling, it is important to follow the recycling guidelines so that it can actually be recycled. Follow any instructions given by your trash/recycling collection service.It may differ by state as well. <br>
    This is the <a href="https://www.wm.com/us/en/recycle-right/recycling-101">recycling guide provided by WM.</a> <br><br>
    On a general note however, food, liquids, straws, plastic cups, plastic dishware, and plastic bags to NOT belong in the recycling bin. Some communities are not recycling glass either so remember to check. Although you do not need to wash food and materials from all bottles, jars, containers, and cans, you should still try to scrap it as clean as possible. Plastic bottles are recyclable and inmost larger communities, it is generally preferred to have the plastic cap put back on the empty plastic bottle before you put it in the recycling bin. Although it is very important to recycle, when in doubt, you should thorw it out. Making a mistake in recycling could cause even good materials to go to landfills. <br><br>
