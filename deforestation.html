  <p class="intro"> 
    Deforestation is the artificial removal of forested land. For thousands of years, trees have been cut down to make space for agriculture and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction. Today, the greatest amount of deforestations is occuring in tropical rainforests in order to constuct roads in regions that were once almost inaccessible. <br><br>
    Slash and burn agriculutre is a big contributor to deforestation in the tropics. With the goal of creating more land for agriculture, farmers burn large forests and allow the ash to fertilize the land for crops. The land is fertile for a few years, however, after that, the farmers move and repeat the process to a new forest. <br> <br> 
    Deforestation can result in more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. (Check out the <a href="airPollution.html">Air Pollution</a> section for more information) Trees take in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis, and carbon is locked chemically in their wood. However, when the treea are burned, this carbon returns to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This greenhouse gas eventually accumulates in the atmosphere and accelerates global warming. <br><br>
    Looking more short term, the loss of trees for a forest can leave soil more prone to erosion. This causes the remaining plants to become more vulnerable to fire as the forest shifts from being a closed, moist environment to an open, dry one. <br><br>
