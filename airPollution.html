  <p class="intro"> 
    Air polution is the release of pollutants in the air, and these pollutants threaten human health and the planet. Acoording to the World Health Organization, each year pollition is responsible for nearly seven million deaths. In 1970, the United States established the Clean Air Act which authorizes the U.S. Environemntal Protection Acency to safeguard public health by regualting air pollution. <br><br>
    Air Pollution is mainly caused by energy use and production.  Air Pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth's temperature.  According to Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist and deputy director of the NRCD Science Center, "climate change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution standards, which are designed to protect health."<br><br>
