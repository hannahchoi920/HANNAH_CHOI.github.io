  <p class="intro"> 
    Water pollution is one of the most serious ecological threats we face today. Water pollution happens when toxic substances, like chemicals trash, bacteria, and parasites, enter water bodies and get dissolved in them. This degrades the quality of water and contaminates it, making the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, etc. <br><br>
    There are many different types of water pollution. Groundwater is when rain falls and seeps deep into the eath, filling the cracks of an aquifer. Nearly 40% of Americasn rely on groundwater for drinking their water. Surface Water covers around 70% of the earth and is what fills our oceans, lakes, and rivers. Surface water filled with freshwater accounts for more than 60% of the water delivered to American homes. Next is ocean water, which is unusable for human activities. 80% of ocean pollution orginates on lands whether along the coast or fair inland. Most of the contaminants consist of chemicals, nutrients, heavy metals from farms, factories and cities, and marine debris, particularly plastic. <br><br>
    There are also many types of water contamination, the biggest contributor being agriculture. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of global freshwater resources, but it's also a serious water polluter. Everytime it rains, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farms wash nutrients and pathogens into our waterways. Sewage and wastewater, meaning used water from our sinks, showers, and toilets and from commerical, industrial and agricultural activities contaminates water. More than 80% of the world's wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused. Besides huge oil spills that on our news headlines, consumers account foor the vast majority of oil pollution in our seas, including oil and gasoline that drips from millions of cars and trucks everyday.Radioactive waste isany pollution that emits radiation beyond what is naturally released by the environment. It is generated by uranium mining, nuclear power plants, the production and testing of military weapons, and the usage of radioactive materials in universities and hospitals for research and medicine.<br><br>
